# ConnectWise Automations

This is a collection of automation bundles that are dedicated around the PSA tool, ConnectWise Manage. Each folder is a unique bundle with its own dedicated Read-Me.

## üìπ Demo Links

Wherever possible, I've included demo links in the documentation for each automation. These demos provide a visual guide to help you understand how the automation works and how you can implement it in your own projects.
